# DOKES

## Abstract
Dokes is a dad joke application built utilizing React and Router, Cypress testing of DOM elements and content, as well as our new tools of MUI and GSAP we have decided to delve into for this project. 

#### Goals and Objectives
- Build a React/ Router application to hone our skills
- Utilize Cypress for testing of our content and DOM items for happy and sad paths
- Research and Implement MUI library componets and GSAP animations for our build to learn, apply and add to our skill list
- Refine our Git workflow and Agile practices
- Have fun fleshing out our own stories as deveolpers
